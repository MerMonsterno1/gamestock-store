<h1>the description</h1>
<p>Adventure by day and risk all night in Need for Speed Heat, an adventure racing game that pits you against the city's rogue police forces as you battle your way to the street racing elite. Compete during the day in Speedhunter Showdowns - a fearsome competition where you earn cash to customize and upgrade your garage of high-performance cars. When your ride is perfectly choreographed and highly coordinated, and you're ready to ramp up the excitement, drive at night and you and your crew participate in illegal street races to raise your profile and gain access to bigger races and better parts for your cars. But lurking in the dark patrols are rogue forces looking to eliminate you and rob you of everything you've earned. Take them down and risk everything you have for underground glory or head to the safety of your home and begin another exciting day. The roads, dangers and races never end in this street racing game as your crew gradually grows, your garage fills with cool cars, and the city becomes an endless race track.
